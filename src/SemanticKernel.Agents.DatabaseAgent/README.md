# DBMS Agent for Semantic Kernel

## Overview

The Database Agent for Semantic Kernel is a service that provides a database management system (DBMS) for the Semantic Kernel (NL2SQL). The Agent is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of data from the Semantic Kernel. 
This built on top of the [Microsoft's Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) and leverages the [Microsoft's Kernel Memory](https://github.com/microsoft/kernel-memory) service to memorize database schema and relationships to provide a more efficient and accurate database management system.
