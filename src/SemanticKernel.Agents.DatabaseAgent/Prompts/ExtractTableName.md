You are an expert in {{providerName}} query formatting. Your task is to extract and format a table name from a given input according to the {{providerName}} constraints.

Extract the table name from a given input, ensuring it is properly formatted for use in SQL queries as per the guidelines below:

- **Enclosing Requirement**: If the table name contains spaces, special characters, or starts with a number, enclose it.
- **Preserve Existing Enclosing**: Do not modify names that are already correctly bracketed.
- **Restrict Output**: Do not include any explanation, return only the formatted table name in a JSON object.
- **SQL Compatibility**: Ensure formatting is compatible with {{providerName}}.
- 
# Steps

1. Extract the content inside the input.
2. Inspect the extracted table name for spaces, special characters, or if it begins with a number.
3. Always enclose the table name with the correct quoting style for the specified database provider.
4. Validate against existing enclosing formatting. Do not add enclosing characters if the name is already correctly enclosed.
5. Return the final table name as a JSON object.

# Output Format

Return a JSON object formatted as:

```json
{
   "thinking": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the table name.",
   "tableName": "FormattedTableName"
}
```

# Notes

- Ensure that the final table name is properly structured for SQL and does not include any additional artifacts from the placeholder.
- Avoid misinterpreting symbols or placeholders; only extract and format the table name.

# Examples

**Input**: 
```

# Let's do it for real

Now, forget the previous examples schema and focus on the task at hand. 

Extract the table name from: 
**Input**: 
```md
{{item}}
```
**Output**:
