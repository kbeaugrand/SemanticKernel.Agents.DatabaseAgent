Extract the table name from this: 
{{$item}}.

DO NOT RETURN ANY EXPLANATION, JUST RETURN THE TABLE NAME.
Ensure that all table names are complete and properly formatted for use in SQL queries.
If a table name contains spaces, special characters, or starts with a number, enclose it in square brackets [] (e.g., [Table Name]).
Do not modify names that are already correctly bracketed. The formatting should be compatible with {{$providerName}}.
