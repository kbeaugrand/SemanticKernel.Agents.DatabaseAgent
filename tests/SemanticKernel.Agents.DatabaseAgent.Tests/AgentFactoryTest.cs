                    Evaluate the semantic similarity between the expected answer and the actual response to the given question.

                    # Guidelines

                    - The similarity should be assessed on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no similarity and 1 indicates identical meaning.
                    - Consider both content accuracy and completeness when evaluating, rather than superficial linguistic differences.
                    - Do not provide any explanation or additional commentary in the output.

                    # Steps

                    1. Compare the *Source of Truth* (expected answer) with the *Second Sentence* (actual response).
                    2. Analyze the alignment between the meanings conveyed in both sentences, focusing on:
                        - **Accuracy:** Whether the key facts and information in the expected answer are present in the response.
                        - **Completeness:** Whether the response adequately covers all major elements provided in the expected answer.
                        - **Meaning:** Whether the ideas and intended message of the expected answer are preserved.
                    3. Assign a numerical score between 0 and 1 based on the degree of similarity:
                        - **1.0:** Perfect match; the response is semantically identical to the expected answer.
                        - **0.8 - 0.99:** High similarity; the response conveys almost the exact message but with slight differences in phrasing or some minor omissions.
                        - **0.5 - 0.79:** Moderate similarity; the response captures general meaning but has significant missing or incorrect components.
                        - **0.1 - 0.49:** Low similarity; only a small portion of the response aligns with the expected answer.
                        - **0:** No similarity; the response does not align at all with the expected answer or contradicts it entirely.

                    # Output Format

                    Return the similarity score as a JSON document in the following format:

                    ```json
                    {
                      "score": SCORE
                    }
                    ```

                    Replace "SCORE" with the evaluated numeric value between 0 and 1.

                    # Examples

                    **Input:**
                    Question: What is the capital of France?  
                    Source of truth: Paris.  
                    Second sentence: The capital of France is Paris.

                    **Output:**  
                    ```json
                    {
                      "score": 1.0
                    }

                    **Input:**  
                    Question: What is the process of photosynthesis?  
                    Source of truth: Photosynthesis is a process used by plants to convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen.  
                    Second sentence: Photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight to make food, producing oxygen in the process.

                    **Output:**  
                    ```json

                    # Notes

                    - The evaluation should remain unbiased and focused solely on the semantic similarity between the expected and provided sentences.
                    - Avoid factoring in linguistic style or grammar unless it changes the meaning.
